# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Make the user’s college name clearly visible in the portfolio by adding it to the Hero subtitle and the About Me introduction.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the Hero section subtitle (under “Meet Desai”) to include: “SAL Institute of Technology and Engineering Research”, preserving existing styling and animations.
- Update the first paragraph of the About Me section to include the same college name, ensuring the existing scroll-reveal animation still renders correctly.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors can see the college name (“SAL Institute of Technology and Engineering Research”) on the landing Hero area and in the first About Me paragraph on both desktop and mobile.
